# The Future of AdzyJS

The initial release of AdzyJS solves a core problem: getting a custom-skinned Minecraft character into a React Three Fiber scene with a single line of code. But this is just the beginning. The vision for AdzyJS is to become a comprehensive, all-in-one toolkit for bringing blocky, stylized game worlds to the web.

Here is a look at the exciting features planned for future versions.

###  Full Animation System

Static models are great, but animated characters are alive. The next major step for AdzyJS is to introduce a complete animation system.

- **Simple Animation Prop:** Control your character's state with a single, intuitive prop, like `animation="run"` or `animation="idle"`.
- **Seamless Integration:** The library will handle loading the animation clips and managing the animation state, so you can focus on your application's logic.
- **Bring Your Scenes to Life:** Easily create dynamic scenes with walking, running, and interacting characters.

###  Direct URL Skin Loading

To make the development workflow even faster, we plan to eliminate the need to download skin files.

- **Paste and Go:** Simply find a skin on a site like The Skindex, copy the image URL, and paste it directly into the `skinUrl` prop.
- **CORS Handling:** The library will handle the complexities of fetching images from external domains, so it "just works."

###  5-Minute Portfolio Maker

Leveraging the power of the `<Player />` component, we envision a higher-level component designed to scaffold a complete 3D portfolio scene in minutes.

- **`<PortfolioScene />`:** A new component that could accept your social links, project details, and a skin URL.
- **Instant Deployment:** Generate a beautiful, interactive 3D space to showcase your work, perfect for developers who want a stunning portfolio without the setup time.

###  More Mobs and Creatures

The Minecraft universe is vast, and AdzyJS will grow to reflect that. We plan to expand the library to include a whole host of iconic creatures.

- **New Components:** Look forward to simple, declarative components like `<Creeper />`, `<Zombie />`, and `<Enderman />`.
- **Build Entire Ecosystems:** Easily populate your 3D worlds with a variety of characters, each with their own models and animations.

###  Beyond Minecraft: A New World of Games

While Minecraft is the inspiration, the core philosophy of AdzyJS—making it easy to render stylized game characters—can be applied to other worlds. The long-term vision is to support assets from other beloved block-based or low-poly games, making AdzyJS the go-to library for this unique aesthetic on the web.
